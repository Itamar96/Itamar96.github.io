    <p><strong>Castillo Piñango, Itamar Benjamín</strong></p>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is <strong>Itamar B. Castillo</strong> (also known as <em>Aethernova</em>).
      I am in my final year of studies to graduate as a Software Developer. Over time, I have grown
      more immersed in technology, and this journey has fueled both my curiosity and passion for learning.
      Outside of academics, I enjoy music, hiking, and working out.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal background</strong><br>
        I balance my interests in communication and health with my passion for technology and problem-solving.
        This combination helps me approach challenges with creativity, persistence, and curiosity.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Academic background</strong><br>
        As I complete my Software Development program, I continue to strengthen my programming, systems,
        and project-based skills, preparing for real-world challenges in the tech field.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Courses I am taking and why</strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>CSC-249: Data Structures & Algorithms (3 credits)</strong> — to improve my problem-solving and coding efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>CTS-118: IS Professional Communication (2 credits)</strong> — to develop strong communication skills for teamwork and documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>CTS-240: Project Management (3 credits)</strong> — to build leadership and organizational skills for managing software projects.</li>
          <li><strong>WEB-115: Web Markup and Scripting (3 credits)</strong> — to strengthen my web development skills and gain confidence creating user-friendly websites.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Interesting fact</strong><br>
        I enjoy exploring new hiking trails. Spending time outdoors keeps me balanced and motivated.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Something I would like to share</strong><br>
        I have learned that technology becomes less intimidating the more you explore it.
        Growth happens when curiosity meets persistence.
      </li>
    </ul>
