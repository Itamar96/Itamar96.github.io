        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
          I, <strong>Itamar Castillo</strong>, agree to abide by the terms in my
          <strong>Fall 2025 WEB115</strong> course with my instructor,
          <strong>D.I. von Briesen</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly
          available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for
          schoolwork or that I want to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up
          for class. Failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Signed:</strong> Itamar Castillo â€”
