  <h3 data-section-title>About Me</h3>

  <p>
    Hello, my name is Itamar Castillo, and I’m in my final year of study as a Software Developer.
    I enjoy music, hiking, and fitness, and I’m using this site to practice my web skills while
    presenting a sample massage brand for class. As I study web technologies, I’m focused on
    building an accessible and consistent portfolio that uses semantic HTML, responsive images,
    and a calm brand voice inspired by my massage concept, Iridescent Cinderwyrm Bodywork.
    I value clarity, comfort, and craft both online and on the table.
