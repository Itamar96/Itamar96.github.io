  <h2>Contract</h2>

  <p>
    I, <strong>Itamar Castillo</strong>, agree to abide by the terms in my
    <strong>Fall 2025 WEB115</strong> course with my instructor,
    <strong>D.I. von Briesen</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly
    available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for
    schoolwork or that I want to keep private.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing
    up for class. Failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
